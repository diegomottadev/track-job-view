# Goal of the project

The project is a web application built using technologies such as Node.js, Express, and TypeScript for the backend, and React.js for the frontend. The backend, developed with Node.js and Express, serves as the server handling client requests, performing operations in the database, and providing data to the frontend.

On the other hand, the frontend is developed in React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces. For the user interface, a component suite called ReactPrime is being used, which provides a collection of ready-to-use UI components specifically designed for React.js.
